				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, officers from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives in Los Angeles walked into Mark Moore Gallery and confiscated one of my recent pieces; &#8220;Improvised Shotgun: White.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/575-improv_rifle_hiRes.jpg"><img alt="576-improv_rifle_hiRes-thumb-615x208-575.jpg" src="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/576-improv_rifle_hiRes-thumb-615x208-575.jpg" /></a></p>
<div>
<p>The officers also requested the current location and bills of lading of recently shipped work of a similar nature. I assume they plan to seize these works as well. The receipt for the initial seizure is shown below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/577-ATF.jpg"><img alt="578-ATF-thumb-200x275-577.jpg" src="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/578-ATF-thumb-200x275-577.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>As of this posting, I have not received any official complaint, cease &amp; desist, nor notice of any kind from the BATFE. Likewise, they&#8217;ve made no requests pending on other pieces in my growing body of RECESS work.</p>
<p>I assume that the actions of the BATFE are a misguided attempt to develop evidence against me for alleged crimes they believe I have committed.</p>
<p>As I have made clear on this blog, other internet sites, and through my demonstrated exhibition record and career &#8211; I am an conceptual artist. My highly public and often controversial works have at time created both challenging and meaningful public discourse. This is the nature of my purpose.</p>
<p>The seizure of my works is a seizure of my voice, and a terrible injustice. I believe the actions of the BATFE today are a violation of my first amendment rights, and an act of overt theft. I am saddened and deeply disgusted that in the midst of this terrible recession, Federal tax dollars are being spent to stifle my rights, seize my work, and question my patriotism.</p>
<p>Everything you can learn about me is here. It is in the combined effort of my labor and the illustration of my ideas. My works are my words, my passions, and my livelihood. Draw your own conclusions and pass this along if you refuse to believe in an America where questioning culture is a crime.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/392-pland.jpeg"><img src="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/395-pland-thumb-600x390-392.jpeg" alt="395-pland-thumb-600x390-392.jpeg" /></a></p>
<p>
The <b>PLAND</b> <b>residency</b> promises an immersive opportunity for spirited,<br />
gritty, and very real daily existence.&nbsp; Situated on a tiny parcel of<br />
land near Taos, New Mexico, this residency offers the direct experience<br />
of living off-the-grid, and will invite new ways of thinking, making,<br />
seeing and collaborating. <br />&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/396-7337215343_ztGTd.jpg"><img src="http://www.chadperson.ubrblk.com/wp-content/uploads/import/396-7337215343_ztGTd.jpg" alt="396-7337215343_ztGTd.jpg" /> </a> Please take some time to review the <a href="http://itspland.wordpress.com/residency-info/">residency</a>&nbsp; overview and application<br />
and consider applying to the program. <b>The application deadline is May<br />
10th and due via email.</b> &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please circulate this, visit the <a href="http://itspland.org/">project site</a> ,&nbsp; join the <b><a href="http://itspland.org/">PLAND</a></b> email list,<br />
follow their <a href="http://itspland.wordpress.com/">blog</a>, and<br />
friend PLAND on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/PLAND-Practice-Liberating-Art-through-Necessary-Dislocation/384752540940?ref=pymk">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><i>What is PLAND?</i> It&#8217;s an exciting new site-driven project started by Erin<br />
Elder, Nina Elder, and Nancy Zastudil. In their own words:</p>
<p></font></p>
<blockquote><p><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>PLAND, </strong><strong>P</strong>ractice <strong>L</strong>iberating</p>
<p> <strong>A</strong>rt through <strong>N</strong>ecessary <strong>D</strong>islocation,</p>
<p> is an off-the-grid residency program that supports the development of<br />
experimental and research-based projects in the context of the Taos<br />
mesa.</p>
<p></font></p>
<p><font style="font-size: 0.8em;"><strong>PLAND</strong> finds its inspiration in a legacy of<br />
pioneers,<br />
 entrepreneurs, homesteaders, artists, and other counterculturalists who<br />
 &#8211; through both radical and mundane activities &#8211; reclaim and reframe a<br />
land-based notion of the American Dream.  While producing open-ended<br />
experimental projects that facilitate collaboration and hyper-local<br />
engagement, PLAND is a constantly evolving artists outpost in the New<br />
Mexican high desert. Through project-based residencies and work parties,<br />
 artists are encouraged to marry survival-based goals with big ideas and<br />
 experimental methods.  Without expectations about prescribed outcomes,<br />
PLAND privileges process over product. Artists can do amazing things<br />
when supported and encouraged in new contexts and there is no context<br />
like that of the Taos mesa. Part alternative school, part laboratory,<br />
part homestead, part art studio, PLAND is an active solution for merging<br />
 art into life.</font></p>
